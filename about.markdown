I am currently a Computer Science student with a passion for the field, specifically, Software Engineering, Data Science, and Machine Learning. I aim to contribute to the world of Computer Science, given how prominent technology is and how it will only continue to grow in the future.

Although I enjoy Programming and reading up on new developments in the field during my spare time, I also take part in recreational activities such as going to malls, playing video games, and watching TV shows.

This site serves as my portfolio which hopefully showcases my experience and passion.
