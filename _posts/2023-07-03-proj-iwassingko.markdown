<h3>Project Description</h3>
<h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The project was done over the course of 1 academic year, or 8 months total with a group of 3.</li>
        <li>The project started with planning the software from scratch, which includes listing the necessary project documents, software requirements, unit tests, and user acceptability tests.</li>
        <li>The project was then developed using the initial plans over the course of 5 Sprints, each sprint consisting of 2 weeks or more.</li>
        <li>The final output was a 2-dimensional Godot Game that follows the genre of Bullet Hell games, with the main character serving as a student that aims to have a high score or final grade.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Contribution</h3>
<h4>
    I played a major role on the planning phase as I was the one with the most experience in Game Development, having worked on several games in Unity before. I served as the main software developer for the project, having learned GDScript and Godot from scratch, while one of my groupmates served as the main asset provider, and the other as the bridge between assets and programming. I was able to deliver my parts as planned, with every bug reported being fixed and adjusted the plan accordingly to sync with the other aspects of the software.
