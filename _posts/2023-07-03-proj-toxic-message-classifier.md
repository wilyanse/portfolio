<h3>Project Description</h3>
<h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The project was done over the course of 3 weeks, with each group consisting of 3 members.</li>
        <li>The project started with planning the model, choosing which datasets to use, which features should be taken into account, developing the model, and comparing the model to other models.</li>
        <li>The project was then developed over a week, with the results analysis done over 2 weeks.</li>
        <li>The final output was a Jupyter Notebook which contained the model, the results of the data we obtained from the model, and an API of the model that could be accessed for future applications to use as a moderation tool.</li>
        <li>The model takes in texts similar to Tweets, and determines whether the Tweet is toxic or not using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, which proved to be bettemore accurate than the t-SNE K-means clustering algorithm.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Contribution</h3>
<h4>
    I played a major role on the data analysis part of the project, while one constructed the model, and the other worked more as a logistics role. I was able to supply points of contention of the project which we quickly solved together as a team. While the model provided all the data we needed, I was able to make sense of the data and to put it into easier terms, as well as conclude which factors were helpful in deterining whether a tweet was toxic, and which model could best solve the problem.
