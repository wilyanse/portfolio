<h3>Project Description</h3>
<h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The project was done over the course of 1 hour, having used my previous knowledge of Python Automation and ChatGPT.</li>
        <li>The project started with an idea from a <a href="https://youtu.be/vGxR98gI930">Youtube Video by Jason Goodison</a>.</li>
        <li>The final output was a Python script that moved my files from an internal downloads folder into an external directory with error logging.</li>
        <li>The python script was run in VSCode but should work well by running it through any other means such as CMD and the likes.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Contribution</h3>
<h4>
    ChatGPT provided most of the code and structure, while I modified it to fit my needs. I gave ChatGPT prompts on the base code structure and modified it from thereon using my knowledge of Python.
